# confidence-intervals
This Python project displays all the basic skills in regards to generating and analyzing confidence intervals. It calculates standard error, z-scores for standardization, and confidence levels, providing a detailed assessment of both large and small sample data. The project computes confidence intervals for both large and small datasets using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.

Key skills demonstrated include:

- Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
- Statistical calculations like standard error and z-scores
- Data Compilation and Data Science practices for clean, scalable code that can be applied to varied datasets

This project is ideal for validating statistical hypotheses and offers data science teams a reliable tool for understanding data variability and making informed decisions through confidence intervals.
